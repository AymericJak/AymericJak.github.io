      <description>Project members : BOBEUF Jules LinkedIn SANTORO Thomas LinkedIn I/ Implementation of the application using Flask So, the application was made with Flask, a micro framework for web development in Python.
We will build a web application based on a three-tier architecture.
The two-tier architecture characterises client/server systems in which the client requests a resource and the server provides it directly. This means that the server does not call on another application to provide the service.</description>

      <description>In this project, a sales management application was developed.
Part I In this first part, the realization of a sales management application without graphical interface is a requirement. This will allow us to use all our skills learned in Java.
Java So we had to make different packages:
The article package This one will allow the management of the articles present in our application.
The client package This one will allow the management of the customers present in our application.</description>

      <description>This is the first concrete project I have done in IT. In this project, the creation of an event company was required. In order to improve its communication, the creation of a website and its design was necessary.
I/ Creation of the company The first step of this project was to brainstorm to find out more about the type of event we were proposing. Once we found our theme, in this case an exposition about dragons, we made different personas to determine the potential targets of our company.</description>

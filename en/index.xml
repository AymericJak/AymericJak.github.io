      <description>I/ Application development with Angular To begin with, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at Angular. It&amp;rsquo;s a client-side framework based on Typescript. The special feature of this framework is its &amp;ldquo;SPA&amp;rdquo; for Single Page Applications aspect. So, our application is on a single web page. The primary aim is to avoid loading a new page, thereby enhancing the user experience.
II/ The goal of the game The objective is simple: to get the best score.</description>

      <description>Project members : BOBEUF Jules LinkedIn SANTORO Thomas LinkedIn I/ Implementation of the application using Flask So, the application was made with Flask, a micro framework for web development in Python.
We will build a web application based on a three-tier architecture.
The two-tier architecture characterises client/server systems in which the client requests a resource and the server provides it directly. This means that the server does not call on another application to provide the service.</description>

Java So we had to make different packages:
The article package This one will allow the management of the articles present in our application.
The client package This one will allow the management of the customers present in our application.</description>

I/ Creation of the company The first step of this project was to brainstorm to find out more about the type of event we were proposing. Once we found our theme, in this case an exposition about dragons, we made different personas to determine the potential targets of our company.</description>

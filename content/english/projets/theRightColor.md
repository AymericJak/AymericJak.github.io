### I/ Application development with Angular

To begin with, let's take a look at _Angular_. It's a client-side framework based on Typescript.
The special feature of this framework is its "SPA" for _Single Page Applications_ aspect. So, our application is on
a single web page. The primary aim is to avoid loading a new page, thereby enhancing the user experience.

### II/ The goal of the game

The objective is simple: to get the best score.

The rules are simple too. A color is displayed on the screen, then click on the associated square. In the example
below:

But be careful: the higher your score, the greater the difficulty!

### III/ PWA (Progressive Web Application)

A progressive web app will make our website look like a native application or a
mobile application.

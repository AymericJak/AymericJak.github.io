Project in which you are currently interacting.

#### Discovering HUGO

1. Discovering a CMS

During this project, we were able to discover what a CMS (Content Management System) is and its importance. It allows to design, manage and update a website in a very simple way. Therefore, as said earlier in the article, this e-portfolio website was created by a CMS which is none other than HUGO.
Why choose this CMS? For the simple reason of the type of content we are going to propose. In the context of this website, therefore a showcase site with static content, the use of the Wordpress CMS was not necessary for reasons of optimization.

2. Markdown writing language

This CMS uses Markdown for content pages, so it allowed me to pick up the language basics.

#### Discovering the *Bulma* Framework

In this project, we were able to discover the bulma framework.
A framework greatly simplifies the creation of a site. Whether in terms of writing code or even in terms of speed in the task.

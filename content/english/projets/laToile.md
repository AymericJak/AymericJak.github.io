### I/ Explore "La Toile", our virtual exposition created in 48 hours

This is our latest university project: "La Toile ", a virtual exhibition of digital images. We chose to represent this exhibition in the form of the Paris metro, with each room representing a metro stop. Our goal was to create this site in only 48 hours and we are proud to have successfully overcome this challenge!

### II/ A virtual exhibition of thematic rooms

" La Toile " allows visitors to browse a virtual gallery by moving from one room to another. In each room, visitors can view a list of digital artworks. We have created several thematic rooms, such as "Pixel Art", which is dedicated to art derived from the pixel cubes of the 90s, or "AI Work", which presents the best Artificial Intelligence artists and their works. We also have a "3D Rendering" room, which presents the most immersive artworks created with 3D, and a "Flat Pattern" room, which presents 2D design.

### III/ An interactive room to encourage visitor engagement

We also included a room where logged-in visitors can add digital art of their choice. We wanted to encourage interaction and engagement with our readers. Anonymous visitors can view the entire site, but cannot 'like' images or post comments.

### IV/ Critical review {class="has-text-danger-dark"}

In only 48 hours, we did not have time to do everything. Some problems still persist such as :
- Authentification
- Routs
- Responsive
- Small details

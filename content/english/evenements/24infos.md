The 2023 edition of the 24 hours of info took place in Bourg-en-Bresse, and was organized by the [IUT Lyon 1](https://iut.univ-lyon1.fr/) ! We were 23 teams in competition.

### I/ How did I discover this competition?

During my computer science degree at the [IUT of Lens](http://www.iut-lens.univ-artois.fr/), our web development teacher told us about this competition.

This year, I also had the opportunity to participate to the [SWERC]({{< ref "/evenements/swerc2023.md" >}}), a really memorable experience!

Since then, I wanted to confront myself with a new challenge and accepted to take it!

### II/ Course of the competition

As its name indicates, this competition lasted 24 hours during which we had to perform 3 consecutive tests of 8 hours:
- Algorithms and Programming (2:00pm - 10:00pm)
- Web Development (10:00pm - 6:00am)
- Security (6:00 am - 2:00 pm)

Followed by the results at 2:30 pm.

### III/ Course of the tests

- Algorithms and Programming

The goal was similar to the SWERC competition, you had to solve the most problems in the least amount of time.

- Web Development

The topic, although it was very short was interesting, here is its title: `Localized information for a smart city/campus/organization.`.
I will make a more complete version of the site we made later this year ;)

- Security

A CTF (Capture The Flag) has been proposed to us.

### IV/ Review {class="has-text-danger-dark"}

Again, it was a very rich experience!

It allowed me to get out of my comfort zone because of the very long hours!

To have been able to meet different students from all over France was a real pleasure!
